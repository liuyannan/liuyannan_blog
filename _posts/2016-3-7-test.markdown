Yes, Jekyll supports syntax highlight. But it looks a little ugly. Below is a piece of python code with highlight effect.

````python
  def fname(x):
    if x < 1:
      y = x ** 2
    pass
````

In studying usage of code block in markdown, I found there were two different methods. First, in most markdown tutorials, `tab` or `space*4` are used to create code block. But the code after rendered is not highlighted with this method. The second method is using two ```` ``` ```` to enclose the code. Then programing language name can be specified after the first ```` ``` ```` to highlight code. Above code piece is generated by

````
```python
  def fname(x):
    if x < 1:
      y = x ** 2
    pass
```
````
.
