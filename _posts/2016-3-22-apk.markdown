Tools we needed are apktool, jarsigner, and keytool. The apktool can be downloaded from [site](http://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool)

1. To decode an existing apk file, we use command below. _old.apk_ refers to the name of apk file to be decoded. _\<dir\>_ gives the directory for generated files during disassembling.

        apktool d old.apk <dir>

2. We can modify the content in the _\<dir\>_  accordingly. Then we generated new apk file with command below. Then the new apk file is in _\<dir\>/dist/_.

        apktool d <dir>

3. The new apk file cannot be installed on phone or simulator now. We need to sign the new apk file before installation. We first need to generate a keystore file for sign, e.g. **bxp.keystore**. Then we sign new apk file with **bxp.keystore**.
    ```
    keytool -genkey -keystore bxp.keystore -keyalg RSA 10000 -alias bxp.keystore

    jarsigner -verbose -keystore bxp.keystore -signedjar <path to apk file after signed> <path to apk file to be signed> bxp.keystore
    ```      
    **The parameters after -keystore and -alias in keytool command must be the same.**

Details for keytool command can be find in next figure.
