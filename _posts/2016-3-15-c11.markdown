I knew C++ standard had been revised several times. But I didn't pay attention to such changes. Recently, I found there were many interesting features introduced. This post would record the interesting features I met.

1) Since 11 standard, thread operation is natively supported by C++.

```cpp
int main(){
    //Create a new thread. func is a general function implemented elsewhere.
    std::thread th(func);

    //Wait for th
    th.join();

    return 0;
}
```

2) Range based for loop. This feature simply the for loop condition.

```cpp
std::vector<int> array[10];
    .....

    //Below loop would increase every element in array by 1.
    /* auto would deduct the type of i automatically.
     * & is for reference.
     * : tells enumerate all elements in array.
     */
    for(auto & i : array){
      i++;
}
```
